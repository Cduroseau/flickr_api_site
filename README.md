A one-page app that uses the flickr photos search API via AJAJ (documented at https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) to search for images and display them.  

1.  The images should be in a scrolling area and the search field should stay on the screen.  
2.  When the user hits enter or presses the search button, it should refresh the display with the new results.  (Please turn ‘safe search’ to the safest setting for the results.)
3.  Show the first 25 images.
4.  Images in the scrolling areas should be resized to fit on-screen fully, and centered horizontally if they don’t reach the left and right edges of the containing element.
